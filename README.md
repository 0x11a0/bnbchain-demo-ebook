### **Building with the oneBNB Ecosystem**

The workshop focuses on leveraging the **oneBNB ecosystem** to demonstrate how decentralized technologies and artificial intelligence can work together to build innovative applications. By combining **AI agents**, **blockchain logic on BSC**, and **decentralized storage on Greenfield**, participants will create a practical, hands-on system that mirrors real-world use cases like e-commerce and digital ownership. Here's the overarching idea behind each component:

---

#### **1. AI Agents for Smart Contract Interaction**
AI agents act as intermediaries between users and blockchain systems. They use natural language processing and automation to interact with smart contracts, enabling functionalities like making payments, querying contract data, and automating actions. This simplifies user interaction with decentralized technologies and lowers the barrier to entry for non-technical users.

---

#### **2. BSC for Business Logic**
**Binance Smart Chain (BSC)** provides a decentralized network where business logic can be executed transparently and securely using smart contracts. These contracts are immutable, trustless, and enable functionalities like token transfers, ownership verification, and transaction processing. Using BSC ensures speed, low fees, and high scalability.

#### **3. Greenfield for Data Storage**
**Greenfield** is a decentralized storage system designed for large-scale data needs. It complements BSC by storing metadata and assets that cannot be directly hosted on-chain (e.g., files, books, images). By integrating BSC and Greenfield, users can manage digital ownership of assets while enabling seamless data accessibility.

### **Key Outcome**
By the end of the workshop, participants will have built a complete mini-application where:
1. Users can purchase, read, and sell e-books using AI agents.
2. Business transactions are managed through BSC smart contracts.
3. Book content is stored securely on Greenfield and accessed conditionally based on ownership.
